# Codfish Paradise Inc.

A fake codfish-recipe themed website made to practice **website responsiveness, HTML structuring and learn new CSS refs, keywords and media queries.**

### Why?

After having been shown [this useful frontend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) I decided it would be best to learn the absolute basics of static-website creation before jumping headfirst into React.

The website was created by following one of [Kevin Powell's](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob/playlists) guides on how to create a responsive website.

One of the main quirks of this project is that almost every single CSS line is commented with what that keyword/ref is doing to change the structure of the website, serving as a pretty neat file to come to later on in the future, maybe. Here's what I mean:

Take a stroll down the styles.css avenue if you're curious!

### Concept(?)

There's no actual concept. The "Codfish Paradise" theme was used simply to avoid utilizing Lorem Ipsum everywhere. Since I enjoy a nice typical portuguese codfish dish, this was an homage of sorts.
